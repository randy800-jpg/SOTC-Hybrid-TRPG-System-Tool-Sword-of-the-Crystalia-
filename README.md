# SOTC-Hybrid-TRPG-System-Tool-Sword-of-the-Crystalia-
This project aims to create a browser-based System Management Tool for the tabletop RPG "Sword of the Crystalia (SOTC)" . The ultimate goal is to enable a hybrid TRPG experience where a human player uses this tool for accurate system processing while utilizing an external AI (e.g., Gemini) as the GM for narrative and descriptive generation.
