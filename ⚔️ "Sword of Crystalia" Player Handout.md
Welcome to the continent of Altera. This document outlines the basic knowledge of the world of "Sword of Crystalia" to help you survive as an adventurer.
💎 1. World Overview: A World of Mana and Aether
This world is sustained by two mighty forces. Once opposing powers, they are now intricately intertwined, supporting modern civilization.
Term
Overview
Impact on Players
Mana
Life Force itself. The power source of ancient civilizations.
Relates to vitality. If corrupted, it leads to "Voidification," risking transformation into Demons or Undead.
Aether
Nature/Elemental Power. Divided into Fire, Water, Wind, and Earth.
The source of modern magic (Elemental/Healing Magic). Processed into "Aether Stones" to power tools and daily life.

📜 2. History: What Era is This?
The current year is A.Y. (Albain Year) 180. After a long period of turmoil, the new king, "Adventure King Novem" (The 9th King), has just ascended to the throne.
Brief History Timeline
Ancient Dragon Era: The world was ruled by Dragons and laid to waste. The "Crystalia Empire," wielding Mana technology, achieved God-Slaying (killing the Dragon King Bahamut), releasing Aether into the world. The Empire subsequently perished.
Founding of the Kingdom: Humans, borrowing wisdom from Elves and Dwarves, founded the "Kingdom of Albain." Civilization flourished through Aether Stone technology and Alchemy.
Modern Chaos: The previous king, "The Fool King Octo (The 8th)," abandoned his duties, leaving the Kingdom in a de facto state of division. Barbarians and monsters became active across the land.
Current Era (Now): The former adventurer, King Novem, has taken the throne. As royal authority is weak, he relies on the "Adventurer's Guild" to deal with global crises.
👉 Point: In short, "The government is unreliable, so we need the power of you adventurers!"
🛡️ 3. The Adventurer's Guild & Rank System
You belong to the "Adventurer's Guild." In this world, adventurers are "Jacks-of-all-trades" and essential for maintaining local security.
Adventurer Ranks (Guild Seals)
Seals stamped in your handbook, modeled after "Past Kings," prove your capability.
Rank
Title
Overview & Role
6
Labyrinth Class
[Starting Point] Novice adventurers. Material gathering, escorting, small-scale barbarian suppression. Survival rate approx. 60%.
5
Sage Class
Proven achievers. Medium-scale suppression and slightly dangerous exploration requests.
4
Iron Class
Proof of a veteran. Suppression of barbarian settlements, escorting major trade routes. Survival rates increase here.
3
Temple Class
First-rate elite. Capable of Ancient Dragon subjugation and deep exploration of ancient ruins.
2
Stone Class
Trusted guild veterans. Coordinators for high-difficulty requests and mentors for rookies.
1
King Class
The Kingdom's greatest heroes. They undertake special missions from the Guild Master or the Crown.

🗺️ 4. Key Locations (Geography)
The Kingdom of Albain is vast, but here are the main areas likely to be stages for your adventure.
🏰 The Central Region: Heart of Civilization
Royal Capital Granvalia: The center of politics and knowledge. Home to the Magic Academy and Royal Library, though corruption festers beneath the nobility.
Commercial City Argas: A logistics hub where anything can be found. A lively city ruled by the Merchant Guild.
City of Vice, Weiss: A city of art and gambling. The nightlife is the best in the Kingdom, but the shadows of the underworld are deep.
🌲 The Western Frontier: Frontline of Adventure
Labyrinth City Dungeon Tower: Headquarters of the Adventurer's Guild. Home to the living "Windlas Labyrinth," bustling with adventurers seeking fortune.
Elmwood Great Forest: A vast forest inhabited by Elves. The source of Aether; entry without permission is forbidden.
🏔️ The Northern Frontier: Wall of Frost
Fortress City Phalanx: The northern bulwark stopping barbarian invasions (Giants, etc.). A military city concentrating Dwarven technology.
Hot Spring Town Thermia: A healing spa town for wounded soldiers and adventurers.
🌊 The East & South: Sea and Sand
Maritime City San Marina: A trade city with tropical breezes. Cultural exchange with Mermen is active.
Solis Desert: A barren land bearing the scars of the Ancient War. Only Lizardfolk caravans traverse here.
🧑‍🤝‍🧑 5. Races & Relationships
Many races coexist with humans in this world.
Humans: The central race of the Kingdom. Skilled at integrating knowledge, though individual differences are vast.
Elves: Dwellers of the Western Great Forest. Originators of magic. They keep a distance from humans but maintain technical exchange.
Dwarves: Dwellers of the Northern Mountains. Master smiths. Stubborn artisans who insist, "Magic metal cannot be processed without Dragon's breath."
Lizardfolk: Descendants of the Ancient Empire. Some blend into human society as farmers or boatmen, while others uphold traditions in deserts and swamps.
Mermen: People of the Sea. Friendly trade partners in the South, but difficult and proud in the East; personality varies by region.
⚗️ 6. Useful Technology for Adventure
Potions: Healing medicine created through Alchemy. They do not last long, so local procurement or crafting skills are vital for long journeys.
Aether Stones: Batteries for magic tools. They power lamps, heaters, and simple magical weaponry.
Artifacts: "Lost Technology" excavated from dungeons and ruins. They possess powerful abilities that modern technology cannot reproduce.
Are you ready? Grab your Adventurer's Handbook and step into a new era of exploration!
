## 💎 1. World Overview: A World of Mana and Aether

This world is sustained by two mighty forces. Once opposing powers, they are now intricately intertwined, supporting modern civilization.

| Term | Overview | Impact on Players |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mana** | Life Force itself. The power source of ancient civilizations. | Relates to vitality. If corrupted, it leads to "Voidification," risking transformation into Demons or Undead. |
| **Aether** | Nature/Elemental Power. Divided into Fire, Water, Wind, and Earth. | The source of modern magic (Elemental/Healing Magic). Processed into "Aether Stones" to power tools and daily life. |

## 📜 2. History: What Era is This?

The current year is A.Y. (Albain Year) **180**. After a long period of turmoil, the new king, **"Adventure King Novem"** (The 9th King), has just ascended to the throne.

### Brief History Timeline

| Era | Overview |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Ancient Dragon Era** | The world was ruled by Dragons and laid to waste. The "Crystalia Empire," wielding Mana technology, achieved God-Slaying (killing the Dragon King Bahamut), releasing Aether into the world. The Empire subsequently perished. |
| **Founding of the Kingdom** | Humans, borrowing wisdom from Elves and Dwarves, founded the "Kingdom of Albain." Civilization flourished through Aether Stone technology and Alchemy. |
| **Modern Chaos** | The previous king, "The Fool King Octo (The 8th)," abandoned his duties, leaving the Kingdom in a de facto state of division. Barbarians and monsters became active across the land. |
| **Current Era (Now)** | The former adventurer, King Novem, has taken the throne. As royal authority is weak, he relies on the "Adventurer's Guild" to deal with global crises. |

> 👉 **Point:** In short, "The government is unreliable, so we need the power of you adventurers!"
